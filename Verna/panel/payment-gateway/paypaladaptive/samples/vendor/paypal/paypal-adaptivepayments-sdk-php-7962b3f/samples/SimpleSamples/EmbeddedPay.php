 * An embedded payment is a payment that initiates a visual presentation of the Adaptive Payments payment flow in which the sender appears to never leave your checkout or payment page. Embedded payments make it easier for a sender to make a payment because PayPal may allow the sender to bypass the PayPal login step. 
 * Use the Pay API operation to transfer funds from a sender’s PayPal account to one or more receivers’ PayPal accounts. You can use the Pay API operation to make simple payments, chained payments, or parallel payments; these payments can be explicitly approved, preapproved, or implicitly approved.
