	/// <summary>
	/// The TransactionData class is an object representing a payment record in the Merchant Database.
	/// Apart from representing a payment record, it also has specialised helper functions to manage locking, creation, querying and updating of transactions.
	///
	/// A method TransactionProcess is also implemented, meant to be extended by the Merchant to handle the final transaction states appropriately
	///
	/// Whilst the below works, it is not meant to be used on production as it is not scalable to support multiple web-servers and/or multiple instances of the site.
	/// Also the below does not stare anything into database, making all TransactionData lost on each web application recycle / restart
	/// </summary>
