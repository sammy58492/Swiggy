WebServices.PHP
============================

Simple PHP web app to demo processing transactions with Mercury's web services platform.

3 step process to integrate to Mercury Web Services.

##STEP 1: Build the request array
    
Create request arrray and add all the Key/Value pairs.
  
```PHP
$requestData = array
(
  	"MerchantID" => $_REQUEST["MerchantID"],
  	"LaneID" => $_REQUEST["02"],
	"TranType" => $_REQUEST["TranType"],
	"TranCode" => $_REQUEST["TranCode"],
	"InvoiceNo" => $_REQUEST["InvoiceNo"],
	"RefNo" => $_REQUEST["RefNo"],
	"AcctNo" => $_REQUEST["AcctNo"],
	"ExpDate" => $_REQUEST["ExpDate"],
	"Memo" => $_REQUEST["Memo"],
	"Purchase" => $_REQUEST["Purchase"]
);
```
  
##STEP 2: Use helper class to process transaction

Store the response array for further processing.

```PHP
include_once("Mercury_Web_Services_SOAP_Helper.php");
$soapHelper = new Mercury_Web_Services_SOAP_Helper();
$responseData = $soapHelper->credit_transaction($requestData, $_REQUEST["Password"]);
```

##STEP 3: Read response array to check for approval

Approved transactions will have a CmdStatus equal to "Approved".

```PHP
if ($responseData["CmdStatus"] <> ""
  	&& $responseData["CmdStatus"] == "Approved")
{
	echo "<font color=\"green\">";
	echo "<h2>Approved Response Data</h2>";
	print_r($responseData);
	echo "</font>";
}
else
{
	echo "<font color=\"red\">";
	echo "<h2>Declined/Error Response Data</h2>";
	print_r($responseData);
	echo "</font>";
}
```
